    "about": " I started my career in Data Science at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, concentrating on research in data analytics and machine learning for complex real-world domains and applications. I tend to be domain agnostic having worked on almost anything from Twitter, DNA, server logs, CRM data, web usage, breast cancer, movie rating and many more. I am still actively publishing and have so far over 50 scientific publications to my name as well as a few patents in the area of machine learning. My claim to fame was winning data mining competitions, as well as several awards from industry and academia. I received my Ph.D. in Information Systems from Stern School of Business, New York University in 2005 and hold a Master of Computer Science from Colorado University. Besides my day job I like teaching and am available for panels, presentations, meetups, and debates around big (and small) data.Short disclaimer (I am sorry - I do not wish to offend): If you want to connect, please write a specific note as to why we should connect or where we met in person.
