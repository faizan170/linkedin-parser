How the journey started?During my previous job at Medizinn, a water testing equipment manufacturing company, one question that always occupied my mind was , Why do the customers buy our product?and finding the answer lead me to discover that the reactions, satisfaction and consumption of a particular product by customers can easily be understood from the \"Data patterns\" That was a start and working days acquiring new  skills, working with non-real data  and applying machine learning algorithm to them have made me more keen to learn more as how to  work with real-data and implement them in real life scenarios.Seeking  for an opportunity where i can apply my creativity and technical skills to explore my potential with a progressive organization.\n... see more",
